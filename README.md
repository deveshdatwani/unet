### Semantic Segmentation On Medical Images Through U Net With Attention Mechanism


### Introduction 

The U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed for biomedical image segmentation, but it can be applied to other image segmentation tasks as well. It was first introduced in 2015 by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox from the University of Freiburg, Germany.

This repository was created to implementat the U-Net architecture from scratch and train it on two publicly available datasets, Kvasir-SEG and CARAVANA. 

The consequent step was to implement the attention mechanism from the paper "Attention U-Net" in order to build a solid understanding of the same.
